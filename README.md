# Eye Tracking


## Introduction

Our dataset is the following. We have two folders:
* `data/open`
* `data/close`

In those two folders, are present images of eyes, either opened or closed. The project revolves around two main tasks:
* Classification: make a classifier that predicts if the eye is opened or closed
* Regression: make a regression that predicts the center of the pupil
